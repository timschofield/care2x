		<b>NOTE:</b> The following installation procedure is valid ONLY for the beta 1.0.0<font color="red"><b>3</b></font>.
		<p>
		If your system has a built-in Apache-PHP-mySQL configuration you can skip the first 4 steps.<p>
			<b>1. </b>Download and install Apache web server in your system.<p>
			<b>2. </b>Download and install PHP script engine in your system.<p>
<p>
			<b>3.</b> Download and install mySQL database server in your system. 
<blockquote>			<u>Configure its access permissions properly</u>. Please refer to the 
			documention of mySQL.<p>
</blockquote>			<b>4.</b> It might be necessary to configure the Apache web server to run PHP scripts as CGI.
			<blockquote>
			Please refer to the documentation of Apache in doing this configuration.
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>5.</b> Download the CARE 2002 beta 1.0.03 scripts in ZIP format (if you have not done it yet).<p>
			<b>6.</b> Uncompress  the CARE 2002 beta 1.0.03 scripts into the active directory of Apache web server.
			<blockquote>
			If you decide to use a different directory name, please refer to the documentation of Apache in configuring the active directory .
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>7.</b> Use an editor and open the file "inc_init_main.php"  in the directory "/include" .
			<P>
			::::::::::  NOTE: (for those who have installed previous versions) This is a different script!    
			<blockquote>
			Enter the proper host, username, and password information for your mySQL database. If your mySQL resides on the same machine
			and uses the same IP address as the Apache web server you can use the default settings. <p>The defaults are:<br>
			host = 'localhost'<br>
			username = 'httpd'<br>
			password = '' (empty string)
			<p>
			Enter the database name. You must remember this name since you need it in creating the database in later steps.<p>
			For example:  $dbname = "caredb";
			<p>
			Change the following three secret keys with unique keys of
			your choice. <P>
			<blockquote>
			$key           : The secret key for the first level script lock.<br>
			$key_2level  : The secret key for the second level script lock.<br>
			$ley_login     : The secret key for the third level script lock.
			</blockquote><p>
			
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>8.</b> Open the file "inc_remoteservers_conf.php" in the directory "/global_conf".  Enter the domain or ip addresses and hosts information.
			<blockquote>
			Note: If the web server is within a network, enter specifically the IP adresses for the hosts. Never use "localhost".
			</blockquote><p>
				
			<b>9.</b> Start the Apache web server.<p>
			<b>10.</b> Start the mySQL database server.<p>
			<b>11.</b> Start your web browser. Currently, we recommend using the MS Internet Explorer version 5+ or Mozilla 1+
			 due to pending completion of cross-programming the javascripts.<p>
			<b>12.</b> Type the following address in your browser:
			<blockquote>
			http://????????/install/manual_install/initialize.php <p>(where ???????? is the actual host address of your Apache web server). The program module phpmyAdmin should be
			displayed.
			<p>
			::::::::::::::::::::: NOTE::::::::::::::::::::::::<p>
			  If the database name is already existing, this script will lock itself and show an invalid access warning.<p>
			The possible solutions:
			<blockquote> <li>Delete the database
			<li>OR go back to step 7 and enter a different database name (one that is not yet existing)
			<li>OR if you want to use an existing database, use a separate phpMyAdmin (not the one integrated in the Care 2002) or any mySQL
			administration program.
			</blockquote>
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>14.</b> Using the program phpmyAdmin (or any appropriate mySQL administration program), create a new database naming it with  the name that you entered earlier in step 7.<p>
			<b>15.</b> Within the newly created database create the tables. 
			<blockquote>
			<li>To do this use phpmyAdmin to run the following sql script "care_db_structure_b1003.sql" found in the /install/sql/ directory.
			<li>Additionally,  run the following sql script "care_db_drg_tables_b1003.sql" found in the /install/sql/ directory.
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>16.</b> NOTE: In this beta 1.0.03 release, you have to run a script to create a temporary Admin access permission (if you are not
			installing it in semi-automatic).
			The temporary admin data are:<p>
			<blockquote>
			username = admin<br>
			password = admin<p>
			<li>To do this, run the "care_db_create_admin_b1003.sql" script found in the /install/sql/ directory.
			</blockquote><p>
			<u>VERY IMPORTANT</u>! In step #19 you will be required to change these initial admin access data with the data of your
			own choice.
			<p>
			
			<b>17.</b> Create the remaining tables. Note: In creating these tables you must follow the order of running the sql scripts as stated here.
			<blockquote>
			Using phpmyAdmin run the following sql scripts found in the /install/sql/icd10_de directory in the following order: (these are the data for
			the ICD10 coding system in german language)<p>
            <blockquote>			
            a2g-insert.sql<br>
			h2n-insert.sql<br>
			o2s-insert.sql<br>
			t2z-insert.sql
			<p></blockquote>
			Similarly run the following sql scripts found in the /install/sql/icd10_en directory in the following order: (these are the data for the
			ICD10 coding system in english language) <p>
<blockquote>
			insert-data-a2l.sql<br>
			insert-data-m2y.sql<br>
</blockquote>			<p>
			Similarly run the following sql scripts found in the /install/sql/ops301 directory in the following order:(these are the data for the
			OPS301 coding system in german language)<p>
<blockquote>			
            insert-data-1-5-499.sql<br>
			insert-data-55-57.sql<br>
			insert-data-58-94.sql<br>
</blockquote>			
  </blockquote><p>
			<b>18.</b> The installation is finished. Enter the following address in the browser:
			<blockquote>
			http://????????/ <p>(where ???????? is the actual host address of your Apache web server). 
			The first page of CARE 2002 should appear. Congratulations!
			</blockquote><p>
			<b>19.</b> CHANGE NOW THE ADMIN ACCESS INFORMATION!  <p>
				<blockquote>
		Select the EDP link on the left menu
			and then select "SQL Databank". Enter "admin" as username and "admin" as password. When the phpmyAdmin
			 appears, open the "care_users" table. Edit the entries containing the following data: 
			<p>name = admin  
			<br>login_id = admin
			<br>password = admin
			<p> Change the values of "login_id" and "password" with values of your choice.
			<p>Now you can start (if you wish) creating access permission for other users. <p>
			To do this:<p>
<blockquote>		Select the EDP link on the left menu
			and then select "Access rights". Enter your admin username and your admin password. When the 
			interface appears, you can start creating user access rights and permissions.
			<p>Note: You cannot create additional Admin permission
			using this interface. You have to use the phpMyAdmin (or any other mySQL administration program)
			 to create additional admin permissions.
