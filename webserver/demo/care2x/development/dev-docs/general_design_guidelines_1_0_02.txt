*******************************************************************

	GENERAL CONCEPT OF THE CARE 2002's  STRUCTURE

	The database and the data contained in it are considered as the BASE of the system.
	The scripts merely act as "functioning agents" between the GUI and the data.
	The GUI merely act as human interface between the user and the scripts.
	
	Following this concept, we strive that:
	
	The database schema must be supported by any type of database.	(We plan to use Metabase classes which currently support 8 databases)
	The scripts ("functioning agents") must be platform independent. (Use of PHP as the programming language)
	The GUI must be platform independent. 	(Use of browser client)
	
*******************************************************************

I. SOME GENERAL GUIDELINES

	A. Using classes.

		1. Group the classes common to a module into a directory under the root directory.
			Name the directory clearly and attach "_class" to it. For example: if you have class
			"linen_class.php", put it into  "/linen_class/" resulting to "/linen_class/linen_class.php".
		
		2. As much as possible, do not use a class which is designed for another module. Create
			the appropriate class for the current module even though the reuse of a class is very 
			tempting. The reason for this is to ensure the robustness of the scripts. Once a class 
			shows a bug during operation, only the module which is dependent on that class will
			suffer and other modules remain functional.
	
		3. Reuse of classes for other modules is allowed only in very special cases. For example when the 
			development time saved is very significant compared to the probable dependencies of multiple 
			modules on that single class.  (See the use of Metabase classes stated at the end of this document)
		
	B. Main functional scripts.

		1. Put all main module scripts into the /main/ directory.
	
		2. Avoid scattering scripts into different directories.
		
		3. Name your script in this format (for example your module is for the Linen department):
	
		Samples:
		
			linen_pass.php (password checkpoint)
			linen_start.php (start page)
			linen_search.php (search page)
			linen_search_displayresult (displaying search results)
			linen_db_input.php (inputting new items into db)
			linen_db_input_save.php (saving the new items into db)
			linen_db_input_save_validate.php (validate prompt)
	
	C. Included or required files.

		1. All include and require files must be placed into the /include/ directory.
	
		2. All external javascript files must be placed into the /js/ directory.
	
		3. All external css files must be placed into the /css/ directory.
	
		4. All help files must be placed into their respective "language" directory under
			the /help/ directory. The language directory must correspond to the
			standard code outputted by the php variable "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE".
			For example: english language outputs "en". So the directory tree looks like this:
		
				/help/en/
		
			The help file itself must be named in this format:
		
				help_en_thenameofscriptusingthisfile.php
		
			Placing it to the directory would look like this:
		
				/help/en/help_en_thenameofscriptusingthisfile.php
			
		5. All language tables must be placed into their respective "language" directory under
			the /language/ directory. The language directory must correspond to the
			standard code outputted by the php variable "HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE".
			For example: english language outputs "en". So the directory tree looks like this:
		
				/lang/en/
			
			The language table itself must be named in this format:
		
				lang_en_thenameofscriptusingthistable.php
		
			Placing it to the directory would look like this:
		
				/lang/en/lang_en_thenameofscriptusingthistable.php
				
			The following is the "official" ISO language code list:
				bg          => bulgarian, bulgarian-win1251
				ca          => catalan
  				cs-iso      => czech, czech-iso
  				cs-win1250  => czech, czech-win1250
  				da          => danish
  				de         	=> german
  				en         	=> english
  				es          => spanish
  				fr          => french
  				id          => indonesian
  				it          => italian
  				ja          => japanese
  				ko          => korean
  				nl          => dutch
  				no          => norwegian
  				pl          => polish
  				pt-br	    => brazilian portuguese
  				pt          => portuguese
  				ru-koi8r	=> russian, russian-koi8
  				ru-win1251  => russian, russian-win1251
  				se          => swedish
  				th          => thai
  				zh-tw       => chinese traditional, chinese_big5
  				zh          => chinese simplified, chinese_gb
					
II. SOME GENERAL SECURITY CONCEPTS

   	A. The concept of chaining the scripts into a strict order.
	
		Care 2002 chains the scripts into a strict order. The reason is to prevent somebody
		from running a script out of the prescribed order. 
	
		For example: 
		Somebody  who has no access permission into the medocs module might try typing the
		medostart.php script into the browser in an attempt to start the medocs
		without passing through the password checkpoint. The medostart.php will
		detect that it is not being executed by the password checker script and gives out
		an error warning.
	
		The only allowed entry into the different modules is via the left menu items, the
		right menu items on home page and links in the submenus.
	
		Schematic sample.
	
		left_menu --> admission_module --> new_admission --> password_check --> data_input_form --> save --> data_preview
		
		There is now way of jumping to the data_input_form directly. This chaining concept must be
		employed in all scripts except in very special cases where the security risk is low and the script involved offers
		no link to high risk scripts.
		
	B. How is the chaining done and what is the "script lock" 
	
		The most important object of the chaining is a random sid (session id) created dynamically at the
		very start of each Care 2002 session (note! it is not the default php SID). This sid  is encrpyted using a secret key.
		The encrypted sid is then stored as cookie at the client side (the reason why cookie acceptance is a prerequisite). 
		Also, the non-encrypted form of sid is propagated all  throughout the program explicitly by adding it dynamically to the urls. 
		
		For example: <a href="medostart.php?sid=2034821841238402">
		The script code of the above example might look like this: <a href="medostart.php?sid=<?=$sid ?>">
		
		A successive script fetches up the cookie sid, decrypts its contents and compares it to the propagated sid. If the two matches, 
		the script assumes that he is being executed by another valid php script and runs normally. However, if the two do not match, 
		the script outputs a warning message and stops the program.
		
		I call this technique the "script lock".
		
		There are three levels of script lock security.
		
		1.) First level security: for normal strict chaining of scripts including low-risk scripts. Only one sid cookie is involved.
		2.) Second level security: this is applied at the scripts of high-risk modules like "Patient admission", "OP Logbook", etc.
		    On this level, a second sid cookie is used containing a sid which is encrypted using a second secret key. This 
			cookie is created every after successful password and username check. Both the 
			first and second level sid cookies are decrypted and compared to the propagated sid.
	    3.) Third level security: this creates an additional difficulty to the second level security. A third cookie is used
		    for this purpose. The third cookie is however not encrypted and stores the user's name that can be applied automatically
			in appropriate forms.
			
		Both the second and third level security sid cookies are erased when the user leaves the protected module.
		The first level security will be erased only (or replaced with a different one) when the user restarts or refreshes the
		browser. In some cases (browser dependent), the appearance of the invalid access warning page might erase the first 
		level security cookie which in turn forces the user to refresh or reload his browser.
		
		NOTE: We are planning to encrypt the propagated sid for added security level. Developers, please be aware of this in the
		future releases. There is a risk of hackers spoofing this sid, even the encrypted one. New or better concepts are 
		welcome.
	
	C. All cookies (except the ck_config cookie) have dynamic names. A cookie's dynamic name is composed of a constant
	   string like "ck_language" plus the session id itself e.g. 1033939393. The cookie's name would be "ck_language1033939393".
	   This dynamic naming is applied to avoid conflicts among different instances of browsers that might run 
	   simultaneously on the same workstation. 
	   
	   Also, the dynamic naming attempts to prevent the danger of "cookie spoofing".
	
	D. A script is not allowed to jump to a script belonging to another module.
	
	E. The concept of "step-in/step-out".
	
		A page must always return to the preceeding page either via the button "Cancel" , "Close", or "Return".
		
		left_menu <-- admission_module <-- new_admission <-- password_check <-- data_input_form <-- save <-- data_preview

		> This concept is based on the observation of common human behavior. If someone steps-in into the
		wrong room, he will never jump out of the window upon noticing the error but normally steps-back and
		go out of that room through the door where he entered before.
		
		NOTE: Even in the return direction, the sid must always be explicitly propagated. Otherwise, the script will
		break the chain and stop running.
		
	
III. MERGING YOUR MODULE TO THE MAIN STRUCTURE OF CARE 2002

	A. Creating the left menu item link. 
			For example you are merging the linen department module.
			The module's link name         : "Linen Department".
			The module language            : English
			The module's first script name : "linen_start.php".
			The module's language table    : "lang_en_linen.php".
			The module's help file         : "help_en_linen.php".
	
		1. Open the "lang_en_indexframe.php" script found in /language/en/ directory.
		
		2. Add the module's Link name ("Linen Department") as array element of the "$indextag" array variable.
			(Don't forget the comma!)
		
		Example:
		
		$indextag=array("Home&nbsp;",
				"Directory&nbsp;",
				"Admission&nbsp;",
				"Medocs&nbsp;",
				"Doctors&nbsp;",
				"Nursing&nbsp;",
				"OR&nbsp;",
				"Tech Support&nbsp;",
				"Laboratories&nbsp;",
				"Radiology&nbsp;",
				"Pharmacy&nbsp;",
				"Medical Depot&nbsp;",
				"EDP &nbsp;",
				"Intranet Email&nbsp;",
				"Internet Email&nbsp;",
				"Specials &nbsp;",
				"Login &nbsp;",
				"Linen Department$nbsp;"
				);

		3. Open the  "indexframe.php" script found in the /main/ directory.
		
		4. Add the module's script name ("linen_start.php") as an array element of the "$targetfile" array variable.
			(Do not forget the comma!)
		
			For example:
			
			$targetfile=array("startframe.php",
					"telesuch.php",
					"aufnahme_pass.php",
					"medopass.php",
					"aerzte.php",
					"pflege.php",
					"op-doku.php",
					"technik.php",
					"labor.php",
					"radiolog.php",
					"apotheke.php",
					"medlager.php",
					"edv.php",
					"intra-email-pass.php",
					"../nocc/",
					"spediens.php",
					"login.php",
					"linen_start.php"
					);

		NOTE: The index number of the script file element in the $targetfile must correspond to the index number of the
		module's link name in the $indextag. You can even rearrange the menu items as long as their link names 
		correspond exactly to their script file names.
		
		NOTE: We are planning to mirror this data into a database table to enable the normal user or admin to
		dynamically rearrange or hide/release menu items based on access permissions and user hierarchy.
		Developers, please be aware of this in the future releases!
		
		5. Save the two files. You now have a link to your linen module at the left menu.
		
	B. Implementing the script chaining, language detect, and user configuration in your scripts.
	
		1. Insert the following lines of code at the start of each and every script you made (except include files): 

		   /**********************************************************/
           define("LANG_FILE","name_of_language_table.php");
           define("NO_2LEVEL_CHK",1);
           require("../include/inc_front_chain_lang.php");
		   /**********************************************************/

           If the script is protected w/ the second level security chaining write instead the following code:
           Where "edp_access_user" is the name of the cookie set after a successful password check

		   /**********************************************************/
           define("LANG_FILE","name_of_language_table.php");
           $local_user="edp_access_user";
           require("../include/inc_front_chain_lang.php");
           /**********************************************************/
		   
           If the script is not protected w/ script lock security but requires language detection, write instead:

		   /**********************************************************/
		   define("LANG_FILE","name_of_language_table.php");
		   define("NO_CHAIN",1);
		   require("../include/inc_front_chain_lang.php");
		   /**********************************************************/

           If the script does not require a language table, define the LANG_FILE to "" (empty string).
		   
		   /**********************************************************/
		   define("LANG_FILE","");
		   define("NO_2LEVEL_CHK",1);
		   require("../include/inc_front_chain_lang.php");
		   /**********************************************************/

		   If the script neither requires script lock protection nor a language table, do not
		   write any of the code lines above.
			
	C. Using the user configured values for your scripts and pages.
	
			The last line of the above lines of codes 'require("../req/config-color.php")' fetches the user 
			configured values and internal flags. This routine delivers the following variables which can be used 
			throughout the script. (at the moment, these are values for colors and internal flags. More are being planned.)
			
			$cfg[dhtml]          // 1 if browser has dhtml capabilities, 0 if no
			$cfg[mask]           // 1 if normal diplay mode with left menu column, 2 if alternative with floating menu child window
			$cfg[idx_bgcolor]    // color value usually for left menu background
			$cfg[idx_txtcolor]   // color value usually for left menu text
			$cfg[idx_hover]    	 // color value usually for left menu hover link
			$cfg[idx_alink]      // color value usually for left menu active link
			$cfg[top_bgcolor]  	 // color value usually for top horizontal frame background
			$cfg[top_txtcolor]   // color value usually for top horizontal frame text
			$cfg[body_bgcolor]   // color value usually for page body background
			$cfg[body_txtcolor]  // color value usually for page body text
			$cfg[body_hover]     // color value usually for page body hover link
			$cfg[body_alink]     // color value usually for page body active link
			$cfg[bot_bgcolor]    // color value usually for bottom frame background
			$cfg[bot_txtcolor]   // color value usually for bottom frame text
			$cfg[bname]          // browser name eg. msie or netscape or mozilla
			$cfg[bversion]       // browser version
			$cfg[ip]             // ip number
			$cfg[cid]            // inactive at the moment 
			$cfg[lang]           // language code as returned by HTTP_LANGUAGE_ACCEPT 
			
		D. Propagating the sid and the language code explicitly throughout the entire scripts.
		
			Create your links to other scripts with the added parameters for sid and language. Use the following
			formats:
			
			<a href="nameofnextscript.php?<?php print "sid=$sid&lang=$lang"; ?>">
			
			or
			
			<a href="nameofnextscript.php?sid=<?php print $sid ?>&lang=<?php print $lang ?>">
			
			or 
			
			print "<href=\"nameofnextscript.php?sid=$sid&lang=$lang\">";
			
		E. Creating the necessary database tables and elements.
		
			1. If your module does not require data from other tables already created in the installation of
				CAre 2002. You can just create your table and elements according to the requirements of
				your modules without consideration of the currently existing tables.
				
			2. Create your table according to this format (for example is the Linen Department):
			
				care_linen_newitems   // sample table for new linen items
				care_linen_olditems    // sample table for old linen items
				care_linen_personell   // sample table for the linen dept's personell data
				care_linen_todo        // to do list
				care_linen_todo_done  // done jobs on the list
				care_linen_todo_trash  // discarded to do list
				
			3. If however, your module does need data from the existing Care 2002 tables, use the
				phpMyAdmin program and look at the elements and table structures of the following
				tables: (You have to decide which table you need).
				
				cafe_menu_de      // canteen menu in german
				cafe_menu_en      // canteen menu in english
				cafe_prices_de    // canteen prices in german
				cafe_prices_en    // canteen prices in english

				tech_repair_done           // reports of technical jobs done
				tech_repair_job            // pending technical jobs

			4. Use the Metabase classes for communicating with the database. You can get the Metabase 
				classes from http://www.phpclasses.org . Please read its documentations on how to communicate
				with the database using the classes.
				
				NOTE: Since the decision to use Metabase classes came after the release of the latest version of Care 2002,
				the Metabase classes are not included in the download package. You must get the classes from the
				http://www.phpclasses.org . Create a "metabase" directory in the root and place the classes into 
				the "metabase" directory.
				
				Example:    /metabase/
	
				NOTE: The use of Metabase classes is a compromise step to the design principles stated at the earlier part of this
				document. A new development of the support for 8 different databases would otherwise take a very long time.
			
IV. COMMITTING YOUR SCRIPTS

	A. Before committing your scripts, set your following database access variables to the the following data:
	
			database host   = "localhost"
			database name   = "care"
			username        = "httpd"
			password        = ""   (empty string)
			
	B. Commit your scripts either to the project's CVS at the sourceforge.net or email them to elpidio@latorilla.com
