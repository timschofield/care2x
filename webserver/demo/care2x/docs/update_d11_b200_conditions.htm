<b>Conditions needed in updating Deployment 1.1 to 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0

<font  face="verdana,arial" size=2>

<b>NOTE:</b>
<ul>
<P>
 The 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0  release is not officially recommended to update the existing Deployment 1.1 !<p>
 Inofficially, you can do an update under the following conditions.
<br>
</ul>
<p>
<b>A. You have not done any modifications of your own in your current Deployment 1.1 installation</b>
 <blockquote>
<li>Reason: There are lots of scripts that were modified in the 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0, and there is a high level of probability that copying these scripts into your 
installation will replace your own modifications.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>B. You are not using the Deployment 1.1 for any real application.</b>
 <blockquote>
<li>Reason: Similar to point A above plus the revisions of the SQL queries for the PostgreSQL support may have introduced a high level of possible bugs.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>C. You are willing to accept the possibility of experiencing more bugs and possible erratic program behaviour</b>
 <blockquote>
<li>Reason: Same as the above.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b> D. You have to extend the database structure by loading the following sql dump scripts (for mySQL only):</b>
 <blockquote>
<li> <a href="http://care2002.sourceforge.net/manuals/update_care_address_citytown.sql">http://care2002.sourceforge.net/manuals/update_care_address_citytown.sql</a>
<li> <a href="http://care2002.sourceforge.net/manuals/create_care_type_immunization.sql">http://care2002.sourceforge.net/manuals/create_care_type_immunization.sql</a>
</blockquote>

<b>I have done own modifications in Deployment 1.1 but I still want to update it with 2nd Generation 2.0.0. Is there a safe way to do it?
</b> 
</font>

<ul>
We recommend that you:
<p>
<li> Copy the 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0 scripts in a separate directory in your web server
<li> Edit the /include/inc_init_main.php script and point it to your existing mySQL database for Care2x
<li> Load the sql dump scripts listed at point D to extend the database.
<li> Run and analyse 2nd Generation beta 2.0.0 and determine which modules and scripts will not conflict with your own modifications.
<li> Copy these non-conflicting scripts to your Deployment 1.1 installation.
</ul>
