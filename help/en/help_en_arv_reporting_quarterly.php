<p>
The quarterly HIV care/ART reporting form is designed to report both on what has happened 
in the previous quarter, and keep track of a cross-sectional summary of all patients currently on ART, 
as of the end of the previous quarter. 
The report includes information both on enrollment in chronic HIV care and initiation on ART
from a single health facility.
The report covers a three-month reporting period, that is, from the first to the last day of the quarter.
